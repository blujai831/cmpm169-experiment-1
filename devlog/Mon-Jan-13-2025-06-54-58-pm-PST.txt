In bin/commit.sh, try to ensure whole devlog entry is printed back before taking a screenshot
In my first bin/commit.sh-generated commit, the screenshot only included as much of my devlog entry as could fit on one line of my terminal. I assume this is because scrot started before cat had technically finished, so I added a 0.1-second delay to try to address this.
