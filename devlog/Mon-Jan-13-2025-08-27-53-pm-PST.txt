Overhaul index.html to personal tastes
I overhauled the website homepage to suit my personal tastes in webdev. I consulted the original the whole time, so I'd say this counts as imitation.

I don't like including JavaScript needlessly in a page, so I removed the script tag for now. I'm sure I can do something interesting with it later, and I'm sure that was the point of it being in there in the first place, so it will probably be back.

I filled out some of my personal details.

I made significant changes to the semantic structure of the page. Where possible, I prefer to make semantic use of elements rather than semantic use of id and class names. I realize it's not a popular opinion these days, and there's probably a good reason for that that I don't fully understand, but, well, as long as I don't understand it...

I decided to use only one stylesheet for the homepage. Rather than putting style rules that should *only* apply to the homepage in a separate stylesheet, I'll try as much as possible to avoid *having* style rules that should only apply to the homepage, and override exceptions in page-specific stylesheets for other pages. On further consideration, this is probably an inferior way of doing things than was setup to begin with, but I don't know, it's just more agreeable to my sensibilities. I just feel like the homepage stylesheet and the sitewide stylesheet should be one and the same.

I moved the nav into the header instead of having it off to the side. Personal preference.

To keep my devlog entries fairly discrete, I'm not yet overhauling the stylesheet. I'll do that next.
