Kick off actually visible work on experiment 5 by following MDN WebGL tutorials.
I'm at the part where I need to understand how the API works beyond just shaders anyway, so I might as well show my progress by actually using my experiment page, and not a different page, to mess around with the tutorials I'm going to have to be following regardless.
