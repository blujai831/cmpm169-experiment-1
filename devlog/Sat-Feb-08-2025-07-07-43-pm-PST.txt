Implement GL demo 4.
I finally get to test some of my own code that I actually wrote myself! And it actually works first try! Woohoo! Still haven't got to the part where I can use my NIPBR shader, but this is a good start. Obviously I was implementing my Transform class off of other online tutorials (linked in the code comments), so I should have known it would work if I followed them correctly, but they were all matrix math, so that was a big "if." Looks like I was successfully able to iron out any mistakes ahead of time.
