Create page for experiment 5, in which I will be working with WebGL2. Upload unfinished code to produce evidence of process.
I don't like to commit work that's so early in development it can't even be tested, but that's the problem with OpenGL, at least as far as I'm aware while I'm sitting here trying to learn it as I go: it seems to me that OpenGL applications are a sort of application you can't test until it's already almost done. Since the experiment assignments require evidence of my process, it seems I'm way overdue for a commit, even if it goes against my personal git netiquette standards. So, phase of the creative process: I'd say I'm in "imitate" right now. I'm mostly just reading about a bunch of math and then translating it into JS and GLSL. The most creative thing I've done is my NIPBR fragment shader. It's complete shit and I'm very proud of it. It works in Godot, which is not to say it's written in Godot shading language, it's not, but when I *translate* it from GLSL to Godot shading language, it works in Godot, so hopefully it will work in GLSL. But again, it's too early to test. I need to first build an app infrastructure out of OpenGL API calls that will actually *use* my shaders.
