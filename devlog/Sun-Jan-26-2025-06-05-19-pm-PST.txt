When preventing the tree from growing a computationally intractable number of parts, only count branches, not leaves and flowers
This is for two reasons. One: it's not necessary to count leaves and flowers, because they can't grow anything more. Two: it's not advisable to count leaves and flowers, because preventing them from growing leaves the branches that would have grown them more vulnerable to random death. Branches undergoing random death before having ever grown leaves or flowers results in the unintended visual effect of the branches extending and then retracting, and if leaf and flower growth is prevented by the hand of logic and not just random chance, then this unintended visual effect is significantly more pronounced.
