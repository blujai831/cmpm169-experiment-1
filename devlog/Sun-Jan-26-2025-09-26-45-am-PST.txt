Slightly adjust month offset of seasons in experiment 3
Adding 1/2 to the month instead of 1 to calculate the current season better aligns the numbers to my code's expectation that the exact index number of each season refers to its middle, not its beginning (e.g. since winter's integer index is 0, a floating-point season value of 0.0 refers to the middle of winter, not the beginning of winter).
