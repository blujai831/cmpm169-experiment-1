Since this will be my final commit for this project, I should take this space to explain why it will be up to a couple hours late, and why it wasn't that ambitious overall. On February 11th, my grandfather died. I wasn't all that close to him, but he lived with us, and I was about ten or twenty feet away from him at the moment he died, and, well, he was family, close or not. That experience gave me enough of a shock to screw up my sleep schedule, which screwed up my medication schedule, and I ended up not taking my meds for the whole week. I'm back on track now, but I lost a lot of time.
