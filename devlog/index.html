    <p>I made this digital painting specifically as a website banner, actually, but for a different personal website. I'm reusing it here because I need some spice and I really like it.</p>

    <p>I used a few lists in my homepage that were ordered in descending order of confidence. As a visual cue for this, I decided to use CSS to color them with a gradient.</p>

    <p>I've started on a basic new sitewide style. This is taking HTML inspired by the HTML we were given, and adding novel CSS to it, so I'd argue it falls under *integration:* combining existing code with a new technique. (The new technique is my stylesheet.)</p>
    <p>The style is very basic right now. I'll work on making it a little bit more fun.</p>

    <h2>Mon, Jan 13 2025, 08:27:53pm PST&mdash;Overhaul index.html to personal tastes</h2>
    <a href="Mon-Jan-13-2025-08-27-53-pm-PST.png"><img src="Mon-Jan-13-2025-08-27-53-pm-PST.png" alt="Overhaul index.html to personal tastes" /></a>
    <p>I overhauled the website homepage to suit my personal tastes in webdev. I consulted the original the whole time, so I'd say this counts as imitation.</p>
    <p>I don't like including JavaScript needlessly in a page, so I removed the script tag for now. I'm sure I can do something interesting with it later, and I'm sure that was the point of it being in there in the first place, so it will probably be back.</p>
    <p>I filled out some of my personal details.</p>
    <p>I made significant changes to the semantic structure of the page. Where possible, I prefer to make semantic use of elements rather than semantic use of id and class names. I realize it's not a popular opinion these days, and there's probably a good reason for that that I don't fully understand, but, well, as long as I don't understand it...</p>
    <p>I decided to use only one stylesheet for the homepage. Rather than putting style rules that should *only* apply to the homepage in a separate stylesheet, I'll try as much as possible to avoid *having* style rules that should only apply to the homepage, and override exceptions in page-specific stylesheets for other pages. On further consideration, this is probably an inferior way of doing things than was setup to begin with, but I don't know, it's just more agreeable to my sensibilities. I just feel like the homepage stylesheet and the sitewide stylesheet should be one and the same.</p>
    <p>I moved the nav into the header instead of having it off to the side. Personal preference.</p>
    <p>To keep my devlog entries fairly discrete, I'm not yet overhauling the stylesheet. I'll do that next.</p>

    <p>In my first bin/commit.sh-generated commit, the screenshot only included as much of my devlog entry as could fit on one line of my terminal. I assume this is because scrot started before cat had technically finished, so I added a 0.1-second delay to try to address this.</p>

    <p>I wrote a script to maintain a devlog page for me. By this means I can easily fulfill the technical requirements of the imitate/innovate/integrate assignment instructions, namely to document my changes and include screenshots, so I can hopefully put a lot more of my focus toward *making* the changes.</p>
