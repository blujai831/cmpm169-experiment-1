<p><strong>This game has music.</strong>
I recommend playing with the sound on.</p>
<p><strong>This game is intended to be played with an external mouse.</strong>
Trying to use a touchpad will pose a harsh disadvantage.
A touchscreen presents unique advantages and disadvantages
that are interesting in their own right, but not strictly intended.</p>
<p><strong>There's more to the game than there may appear to be
at first glance.</strong> Interesting things start happening
once you've successfully clicked the button at least 5 times.
(You'll know you clicked it successfully if it turns light-red.
If it doesn't, the click didn't register.) You'll have seen everything
there is to see once you've gotten a game-over with more than 30 points.</p>
