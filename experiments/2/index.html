<p>This game is intended to be played with an external mouse.
Trying to use a touchpad will pose a harsh disadvantage.
A touchscreen presents unique advantages and disadvantages
that are interesting in their own right, but not strictly intended.</p>
<p>There's more to the game than there may appear to be at first glance.
Interesting things start happening once you've successfully clicked the button
at least 5 times. (You'll know you clicked it successfully
if it turns light-red. If it doesn't, the click didn't register.)
You'll have seen everything there is to see once you've gotten a game-over
with more than 30 points.</p>
