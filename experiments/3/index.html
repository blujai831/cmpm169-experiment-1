<p><del>I didn't use my time well, so this experiment
will be significantly less ambitious than experiment 2, but I still intend
to put in creative effort.</del> Actually, with most everything said and done,
I feel I can look back on this project and say it wound up being pretty robust
in spite of time constraints. The idea was simpler, and may have required
less efort to execute just because of that, but the end result
is at <em>least</em> equally expressive.</p>
<p>In grow mode, if you click and drag anywhere on the canvas,
the tree will try to grow in the general direction of that point.
In prune mode, if you click and drag over any branch,
that branch and all of its descendants will die.</p>
