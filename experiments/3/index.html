<p><del>I didn't use my time well, so this experiment
will be significantly less ambitious than experiment 2, but I still intend
to put in creative effort.</del> Actually, with most everything said and done,
I feel I can look back on this project and say it wound up being pretty robust
in spite of time constraints. The idea was simpler, and may have required
less effort to execute just because of that, but the end result
is at <em>least</em> equally expressive.</p>
<p>In grow mode, if you click and drag anywhere on the canvas,
the tree will try to grow in the general direction of that point.
In prune mode, if you click and drag over any branch,
that branch and all of its descendants will die.</p>
<p>The tree's autonomous growth behavior varies with the diegetic season,
and since the simulation starts at the beginning of the year,
which is in winter, the tree's autonomous growth behavior is not immediately
very interesting. Please try to wait at least until the simulation
reaches February before deciding you've seen everything it has to offer.
From boot, at exactly 3 seconds per diegetic day, it will take 1 minute
and 33 seconds to reach February. The colors change with the season as well,
so if you're interested in seeing the full spectrum of palette swaps,
you'll have to wait the full diegetic year, which takes roughly 18 minutes
and 15 seconds total, though I certainly wouldn't blame you
if you don't have time for that.</p>
