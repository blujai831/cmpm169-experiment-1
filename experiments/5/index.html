<p>To the grader (whose name I omit for privacy):
I realize the end result may not be up to par in terms of visual impact,
but please consider what exactly is being showcased here.
What you see here is a fully custom and original PBR shader
rendering a cube via raw WebGL2, without relying on a higher-level framework,
in a 3D space simulated by the beginnings of a custom 3D library,
equipped with a class for vectors in R3 and a class for quaternions,
as well as a higher-level class which makes use of the prior two
to offer more general affine transform functionality,
including generating matrices to pass to the vertex shader
(without the use of a library such as mat4).
In short, <em>I</em> did <em>everything</em> you see here.
Well, not <em>everything.</em> I didn't write your internet browser
nor its JavaScript engine, and I didn't build your graphics card
nor flash its firmware, nor write the WebGL spec,
nor the OpenGL spec more generally, nor the GLSL spec, etc.
But I'm not using something like P5 or Three or anything like that.
This is <em>all vanilla.</em> It took me all the time I had
just to <em>learn how</em> to accomplish what you see here.</p>
<p>The weird lighting artifacts are intentional.
That happens because the cube's metallicity map is just a white background
with "bar" written on it in huge black letters,
and the cube's roughness map is just a black background
with "foo" written on it in tiny white letters.
These maps are included to demonstrate that my PBR shader is full-featured:
the point is to show that it <em>supports</em> metallicity and roughness,
even though how they're presented here is not really something
that would naturally occur.</p>
<p>The strange orbiting behavior of the cube is intentional as well,
and is in place to test my view-perspective matrix and the correctness
of transforms upon it. Other than spinning, the cube actually only moves
with your mouse, and only goes wherever your mouse goes,
but an illusory orbiting behavior is observed because the camera,
not the cube, is continuously spinning on the Z axis.</p>
<p>This was the final missing piece. At this point, I finally know
everything I would need to know to personally and individually write
a whole 3D game engine from scratch. I probably won't do that,
because it sounds very painful and the end result would probably suck,
but at the very least there are no longer any knowledge barriers.</p>
<p>My shader is nothing special. Actually I think it's kind of ugly.
Even so, I worked hard on it and am proud of it. I'd like to showcase
its actual code below:</p>
<code><pre id="nipbr-source"></pre></code>
<p>The exasperated woman pictured on the cube is the protagonist
from Void Stranger, known variably as Lady Gray or Gray the Destroyer.
I didn't draw the sprite but am using it anyway because it's funny to me.</p>
